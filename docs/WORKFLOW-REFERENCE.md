# Workflow Reference

Quick reference for workflow patterns. For detailed explanations of why the workflow is organized this way, see [How It Works](how%20it%20work.md).

## Artifact Flow

```text
memories/repo/constitution.md
memories/repo/project-knowledge-base.md
        ↓
artifacts/features/<slug>/analysis.md
        ↓
artifacts/features/<slug>/spec.md
        ↓
clarification resolved or explicitly marked non-blocking
        ↓
artifacts/features/<slug>/requirements-review.md
        ↓
artifacts/features/<slug>/design.md        (optional)
        ↓
artifacts/features/<slug>/plan.md
        ↓
artifacts/features/<slug>/tasks.md
        ↓
implementation + validation
        ↓
artifacts/features/<slug>/review.md        (optional)
```

## Quick Decision Rules

- Start with repo memory only when durable repository context is missing or outdated
- Use `analysis.md` for brownfield discovery and risk reduction
- Do not plan from a vague or still-blocked spec
- Use `design.md` only when it reduces planning ambiguity
- Let `spec-requirement` own clarification before review
- Make `plan.md` explicit enough that `spec-tasks` can break work down without inventing technical strategy
- Make `plan.md` explicit about affected domains, integration boundaries, protected behavior, and validation
- Make `tasks.md` explicit enough that `spec-implement` can execute selected tasks without inventing missing scope, ordering, or validation
- Make `tasks.md` explicit enough to pass a final REQ -> AC -> TASK -> validation audit
- Use `spec-implement` to execute the next unblocked task by default, and stop instead of coding through unresolved blockers
- Implement from `tasks.md`, not from vague chat intent
- Review implementation against approved artifacts, not against memory alone

## Workflow Patterns

### New Repository

```text
/constitution
/project-knowledge-base
```

### Minimal Localized Change

```text
/spec-requirement
/spec-review-requirements
/spec-plan
/spec-tasks
/spec-implement
/spec-review
```

**Skip:** `/analyze`, `/spec-design`

### Brownfield Or Risky Change

```text
/analyze
/spec-requirement
/spec-review-requirements
/spec-design
/spec-plan
/spec-tasks
/spec-implement
/spec-review
```

**Include everything.** Investigation happens first.

### Bug Fix Or Regression

```text
/analyze
/spec-requirement
/spec-plan
/spec-tasks
/spec-implement
/spec-review
```

**Skip:** `/spec-design` (unless scope is ambiguous, then optionally add review)
